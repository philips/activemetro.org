# Welcome to Portland Metro Active Transit Advocates

![active metro logo bike with tree](activemetro.png#floatright)

**Do you ride a bike? Do you walk? Then join us!**

We are a (fledgling) community group organized to ensure all parts of the Portland Metro Area from North Portland to West Linn and from Forest Grove to Wilsonville are great and SAFE places to bike and walk.

The Portland Metro area already has some great pockets of trail infrastructure that we can recommend and we would love to add more. Please [send me an email](mailto:brandon@activemetro.org) with places you love to walk or bike for utility or pleasure.

## Dedicated Active Transit Trails

This is a list of dedicated infrastructure for active transit that limits the interactions people have with dangerous motor vehicle traffic. This type of dedicated active transit infrastructure is critical for people to feel safe getting their families out of their cars for regular transit needs.
